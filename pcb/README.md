# PCB

This is a PCB design that implements the connections between the 220VAC relays and optocoupliers and the ESP board, along with all the necessary 3D printed parts to enable component mounting. The circuit schematic and the PCB layout are printed in the `pcb-schematic.pdf` and `pcb-layout.pdf` files respectively.
